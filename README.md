# PHP ChipEight Emulator

I don't know how many turing mashines deep this is but here is a Chip8 Emulator written in PHP. 

Built on [PHP-GLFW](http://github.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw) and the [VISU](https://github.com/phpgl/visu) framework.

## Features

* **It runs Chip8 ROMs!**  
  This is obvious, but the moment it started working was magical to me, so I'm putting it here.
* **Debugger**  
  You can step through the code and see the state of the registers and memory.  
  Press `space` to pause or hit the _Pause button_.

* **Drag and Drop**<br>As seen in the demo, you can simply drag and drop your ROMs onto the emulator.
* **Fullscreen mode**<br>
  If you don't care for all the debugging stuff, you can simply go fullscreen and enjoy the game.
* **Virtual Keyboard**  
  You can use the keyboard in the GUI or use the keybindings:

* **Ghosting Effect**  
  I'm honestly not very knowledgeable about old hardware, but I'm assuming that the old CRTs would take some time for the phosphor to fade out. I tried to emulate this effect by adding a ghosting effect to the display, as the flickering otherwise is quite unpleasant.  
  You can change the strength of the effect.

* **CRT Effect**  
  Some might hate this effect; I like it, but of course, you can turn it off.

* **GUI!**
  The GUI is created using an immediate mode style of drawing. You get results really quickly, the code is really ugly and performance is really not great.
