# PHP ChipEight Emulator

I don't know how many turing mashines deep this is but here is a Chip8 Emulator written in PHP.

![demo](https://github.com/mario-deluna/php-chip8/assets/956212/ae03baa0-8a00-4872-8131-39ca420a6310)

## Features

* **It runs Chip8 ROMs!**<br>
  This is obvious, but the momemt it started working was magical to me so I'm putting it here.
* **Debugger**<br>
  You can step through the code and see the state of the registers and memory.
   Press `space` to pause or hit the _Pause button_.

* As seen in the Demo you can simply drag and drop your roms onto the emulator.
* **Fullscreen mode**<br>
* **Virtaul Keyboard**<br>
  You can use the Keyboard in the GUI or use the keybindings:

* **Ghosting Effect**<br>
  Im honestly not very knowledgeable on old hardware but Im assuming that the old CRTs would take some time for the phosphor to fade out. I tried to emulate this effect by adding a ghosting effect to the display as the flickering otherwise is quite unpleasant.
   You can change the strength of the effect.

* **CRT Effect**<br>
  Some might hate this effect, i like it but of course you can turn it off.
